         "name":"SANDTOWN",
         "info":"General Information:\n   Sandtown is a standard map in Arsenal. The map takes place in a Middle Eastern market district. It is the second smallest map in the game, with Bridge being the smallest.\nThere are planks connecting buildings and roofs to buildings. On ground level, it features a fountain in the heart of the map, narrow pathways leading the buildings, and a wide and open space, making it not much of a hassle to find the action. It also features a little shack containing hay, ways to get up to the buildings as mentioned earlier, and the carpeted inside of the buildings.\nShortly after the start of a round on this map, a scripted event occurs in which a plane crashes into the tallest building on the map, with its right wing falling off and bridging the balcony near the bottom of the building with a nearby staircase. The plane can then be reached by Rocket/Recoil Jumping.\nOn the other two buildings, they have a metallic plank (aka. the plane's wing) connecting them, and a staircase leading up to one of them. Also, it features a stone arch which leads to another part of the map where there is a little plank leading to the other side, a way into one of the carpeted buildings, and more. One spawn point is wide open to players ready to shoot at you.\nThere all sorts of chokepoints, including the area underneath the crashed airplane to the left rooftop of the building left of the wires.\n Tips and Tricks: \n    Sandtown, being one of the smallest maps in the game, means there will always be a firefight somewhere on the map, no exceptions. With constantly shifting spawns, bullets flying from every corner, this map promises never-ending action gameplay.\nSpawns are likely to shift at any given moment and pay attention to where your teammates are heading and figure out where the enemy is going to come from next.\nWhile heights are often a huge advantage in other maps, in Sandtown, it is relevant. The small map size means that the enemy could come from anywhere. The only option is to stay on your toes and eliminate anybody who crosses your path.\nExplosives and shotguns are useful on this map. Enemies are likely to press their faces against the camera or bunch up constantly, so take advantage of those situations!\nThe plane is a viable camping spot, but as stated before, you're likely to either fall behind or get picked off.\nYou can walk on the clotheslines by platforming on the arch near the building spawn. While it might not be too useful, since it leaves you open, it's good if your opponents are focused on where your teammates are. Flank them and secure kills.\nThe Golden Knife is extremely dangerous in this map, since the wielder can quite literally jump from anywhere with its double jump capability. It has many parkour queues. If you happen to get your hands on it, platform onto a higher spot and get the drop on an unsuspecting enemy. Preferably, a rooftop.\nThe middle of the map is usually where the fights go on play, go seek for higher heights to not be part of it.\nThe building that looks over the entire center of the map can easily be ambushed if you fail to keep track of the stairs. Check the route on the side to quickly deal with flankers."

         "info":"Map Information: \n   Safehouse takes place in a hilly woodland area with a craftsman styled house as the focal point. The map is inspired by the CS:GO map, de_safehouse, but has a different layout outside of the house.\nMultiple rocks, rocky terrain, and trees make it a extremely dynamic map, providing natural cover or vantage points. A cobblestone wall blocks the two sides of the map, however there are some ways around it, with there being a shed that you can climb over to get to the other side, and a 2 planks on the other. \n Tips and Tricks: \n Safehouse is the most straight forward map of all of the maps. With an open spawn area and a closed house area, a skirmish is likely always happening on this map.\nMost players will try to get as many kills as possible going through the main hallway and the kitchen. If you want to get the drop on them, go through one of the windows and flank.\nThe roof is a very strong vantage point, especially if the enemy is spawning in the lower spawns. If you get there, exploit it to its fullest potential.\nIf you want to avoid the house in its entirety, go to the walls and use the planks to flank the enemy.\nThe lower spawn is possibly the worst area to be in on this map. It is, quite literally, an uphill battle from there. Work with your team to push and regain the upper spawn, then turn the tables!\nThe stairs are a nice section to camp on if the enemy is spawning from the upper spawns. Since most of them will be looking down the hallway, pick off any unfortunate souls, then book it once you start getting shot at.\nThe roof, the trees, and the large window on upper-spawn side of the house can be used to get the drop on anybody walking into the hallway. This is especially useful when you're on the Golden Knife.\nWhich is that you're likely to have a hard time getting a kill on this map unless the person you're chasing is inside the house. Use any of the flank routes mentioned above, and win!"

         "name":"AGENCY",
         "info":"General Information:\n   Agency is a map originally from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive as a hostage map. It takes place in a commercial penthouse ontop of a skyscraper. The interior is a two-floor office. The first floor has a giant, open lobby with stairs leading up to the second floor, along with two hallways leading to a small cafeteria and a large space. Said large space is overlooked by a balcony.\n   On the second floor, the stairs from the lobby lead into an office space, which connects via an upstairs balcony-way to the main offices. The main offices contains a conference room, a janitor closet, and workspaces.\n   Agency has multiple windows on the second-floor main office, though they do not have glass, unlike its origin, Counter Blox. Falling off the map causes the player to lose a level since it is an environmental kill.\n   Around the map are several colored balls. The colors of these balls include red, yellow, green, blue, purple, and pink.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   Agency is a map with many rooms, and action happening at every corner. How do you survive?\n   The map is mainly suited for close-quarters, up-close and personal combat.\n   Explosive-weapons such as the M16A2 are extremely devastating at close range: With hardly any room to maneuver in such tight space, a single blast could kill multiple players in one shot.\n   Shotguns also find their niche here, with their capability to fill a narrow, tight space with dozens of pellets in a second.\n   If you climb up the staircase in the room that leads outside, you can find some small openings to shoot through."

         "name":"DIZZY",
         "info":"General Information:\n   Dizzy is a map in Arsenal, and can be played in all gamemodes with the exception of Brickbattle and Laser Mania. It's also locked to 2 teams, and cannot be played in 4 teams or FFA, even if they're voted for.\n   Dizzy takes place to be set on top of a tall building undergoing construction at the top, with two identical (save for color) main buildings separated by a lower tunnel, ladders, and a large bundle of wood able to be traversed upon.\n   Falling off of the building will result in dying and losing a level, just like any other map hazard. It is one of the smallest maps in the game, only overshadowed by Sandtown and Bridge.\n   It is possible to reach the top of the crane either using the DBS's, Barrett's or DB Shotgun's recoil jump ability, or a rocket jump. However, rocket jumping on the crane can be harder.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   Dizzy is an easy map to memorize, being near-perfectly symmetrical and straightforward. Most skirmishes will occur in the center area between the two buildings above the basement. Since the spawns aren't that far apart, they swap frequently. Please watch your back.\n   This map has few checkpoints, so there are few options when it comes to flanking. The basement is often forgotten, however, so use it to sneak behind the enemy lines and secure several kills when possible.\n   The small house is a particularly strange spot, as it can be your best friend or your greatest enemy. The secluded area leaves your enemies quite literally small windows to damage you. However, you are very, very susceptible to explosions within it. If someone happens to enter, try to demote them using your knife, as there's little room to run for them.\n   The crane is another strange spot. While it might be ideal for camping, it's absurd height makes it not so ideal. However, this spot is a killer in Clown Infection, make your way up there and escape the horde!\n   The roofs of both of the buildings are good vantage points, especially when there are fewer players around. However, you are at risk for an attack from behind, since the roofs are rather close to one of the main spawns, be careful!\n   The ladders are an often overlooked place to secure kills. People tend to forget they are being shot at when climbing one, so take advantage.\n   Since the map is so small, the Golden Knife has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on placement. Out of spawn, it's extremely likely you'll be killed before you can even get close, considering the map size. However, if you manage to move well, you can easily snag a kill, as the enemies will most likely be distracted by the center skirmish.\n   If you happen to knock someone off the map with an explosive weapon, focus on someone else as the other person falls.\n   If you spawn on the bridge section, be mindful of where you're going. A common mistake with players who want to get to the front lines quickly is accidentally walking off the bridge and losing a level.\n   There is also another secret where you can shotgun jump onto the top of the crane and see multiple lines of texts inside.\n   If you fall off the map, but have an explosive weapon that can rocket jump, or a DBS and DB Shotgun, hug the wall and shoot below your feet. Hugging the wall will cause you to fall slower, and allows you to rocket jump as well.\n   It's fairly easy to predict spawns. If most of your team are on one side of the map, the enemy will likely spawn on the other side."

         "name":"ASSAULT",
         "info":"Map Information:\n   Assault is a recreated version of the popular CS:GO and CS Source map known as: cs_assault. It takes place around an industrial warehouse, with access to the area being blocked off. It's separated into 5 distinct parts, the train station, the warehouse on the left side of the map, the two parallel streets next to them, and the long street that connects the warehouse and the parallel streets.\n   The Warehouse has an upper section and a lower section. The upper section has a door in the back that leads to one of the parallel streets, and there is also a door in the lower section that leads to the same street. There is a larger warehouse door that leads to the long street.\n   The Train Station is positioned above the rest of the landmarks, making it a good place to camp.\n   The two parallel streets just lead onto the main connecting road. People will spawn at the end of these roads, so it's nice to dip around and shoot some of them. The two parallel roads are connected by a small alleyway that houses a few trash bags and broken cars.\n   The main street connects all of the previous landmarks. You can enter the warehouse, go onto either of the two parallel streets and walk up to the train station. There aren't any decent barricades on this street, and makes you slightly easier to hit.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   A map straighter than a railgun shot, choked by a small garage, accented by a stocked warehouse, and tied into a knot of endless firefight with the trademark train station, Assault is a map that has two simple states of combat: constant straight shooting chaos, or hilariously one-sided vantage pushes. Considering that most matches in Arsenal aren't that coordinated, you can count on the first happening most of the time.\n   Many weapons that have tight spread and good accuracy are extremely powerful in this map due to the amount of open space and straight sightlines. Snipers are also considerably more useful than normal thanks to this, allowing potentially awful weapons such as the M40 and MS556 to become somewhat easier to get past.\n   Common spawns are in the warehouse, at the end of the streets, and near the stairs that lead to the top of the train station. The warehouse spawn is one you'll want to target often as there is little chance for interruption thanks to it being a closed space. You'll likely snag several kills if you place your shots right as most would be expecting the enemy to come from outside the warehouse, so get flanking!\n   Rocket/recoil jumping poses a large advantage, going quickly from one side of the map to another. This becomes much more useful when you reach the roof of the garage, as it not only covers the roof of the warehouse, but pretty much every other part of the map aside from inside the warehouse. You can also access the train station roof, a more niche spot due to it making you a bigger target than Hackula, but somewhat useful as well. It's got a nice view, after all.\n   Spawncamps are really prevalent and easy to perform in this map, especially on the street spawns. These spawns have ZERO protection, so whoever spawns there will fall victim to anybody aiming in the general direction of them. If you happen to see someone pop into existence in that general area, raise hell.\n   Knifing in general on this map is pretty painful, thanks to how open it is. The only remotely viable spots to even attempt it is in the warehouse, garage, and the stairs up to the train station. Even then, it's really easy to get any of your tries to demote your foes shot down. This makes the Golden Knife difficult to kill with, as you have to hope and pray that an opponent will be lined up in what would essentially be a perfect spot. Try to go for the good knife spots, or just camp around and challenge a knife fight in the warehouse if you're feeling chicken."

         "info":"Map Information:\n   Boulevard is a map released in the 2.5 update. It's a very large and spacey map that favors long-ranged weapons such as snipers, or perfectly accurate weapons. However, it does provide some areas where you can confront enemies in closer ranged combat, so inaccurate weapons aren't completely useless.\n   Boulevard takes place in a residential suburban city with multiple shops.\n   The map features many places to go into. These things include a track where a trolley comes to run over anyone in its path, resulting in a demotion (you can hear it coming by its ringing sound); a gas station called Scoobies; a coffee shop called Stinky's; a juice store called Stink Juice; and multiple vehicles scattered around the area.\n   The small buildings have nice rooms that overlook the main road and gas station. As long as the area is secured with a small team, domination is essentially guaranteed. However, retaliating players may simply counter-snipe or use explosives to dislodge you.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   Boulevard is a very open map with action in specific areas. How do you win?\n   If you have shotguns or high spread automatics, these are your best friends at the gas station, parking lot, and inside the buildings.\n   If you happen to have a weapon with the Rocket/Shotgun Jumping ability, use this to your advantage to hide on top of buildings to mow your enemies down below.\n   The spawn locations on this map can give you and your team a great opportunity to corner the enemy.\n   The trolley can be easily avoided because of its distinctive sound, however, this does not mean to always stay at its path.\n   Scoped weapons such as the Barrett or the G11 can be easily used for picking off enemies at longer ranges.\n   The Golden Knife is arguably the best or worst in situations. For flanking, either go behind the office buildings or behind Stinky is Coffee shop.\n   The skin Froggy is obtainable here by killing 5 people near a frog. The frog will get bigger and bigger until it will start hopping to get the skin. You have to follow it and it will lead you to a door with wood on it. You have to break that wood and when you're finished breaking it, it will teleport you to a different server with a different map, the Apartment. You will see a stand with moving animals on it. You have to shoot all the animals except the frog until confetti comes out of the stand, and that means you got the Froggy skin\n   You can get the unusual Froggy skin by doing the Froggy quest normally, but you have to time the Frog and the train to make them collide."

Players who get hit by one of these cars can be killed.\n   Street Corner also has a sewer, which is an L-shaped corridor with two levels, accessible by ladder. The sewer is a very popular part of Street Corner, due to the spawns within and easy to access routes to its location.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   If you want to find an alternate route, the most obvious are above the sewers, where you can flank.\n   Spawns tend to be very random and will mix up so be wary and check all possible spawns, at the end of the sewers, entrances to the sewers, and more."

There are tunnels on both sides of the map to connect the pathways. The terrain is rough outside the buildings leaving one team to fight up the hill.\n   There is almost no cover in this map, so players cannot hide behind a wall to avoid being hit. This will most likely result in very quick deaths, so players must try to get as many kills as possible before dying. This map relies on brute-forcing attacks, where the most successful player is the one that can get the most kills within a short time span.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   Hillside is a fairly large map. Try to flank as much as possible so you could eliminate players by surprise.\n   Long-range weapons strive on the hill part while close-range weapons strive in the corridors\n   Like the first tip, it is a fairly large map, and flanking could take a while. The PIZZA can be useful in this situation, giving you the speed boost and allows you to catch up to opponents, probably the easiest way to get a knife kill."

There is also a lot of cover in this map.\n   There was a placeholder map exclusive to private servers called Kitchen 2020, it is a revamp of Kitchen Khaos.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   Most of the fighting will occur under the table and near the spawns.\n   All of the spawnpoints except for the mousetrap spawnpoint are ideal places for camping. However, be aware that more proactive players will use the trampoline in the brick fort to try to pick you off.\n   The trampolines are extremely useful, as they allow you to get to the main spawns quickly, and also allow you to perform creative flanks.\n   Kitchen Khaos supports almost every playstyle. If you like camping, sit around at spawn.\n   While all of the spawns are viable camping spots, the cabinet spawn near the sinks is arguably the best one, as you get the best view of the place.\n   The Knife is incredibly useful in this map when taking the trampolines into consideration.\n   Weapons that can boost jump are particularly useful in this map, allowing ease of movement without the use of trampolines. This can catch opponents off guard easily since most would expect people to fly near the trampolines.\n   Normally, in 2 teams, you would spawn either side of the map. If you get the spawn near the grill and see some campers on the opposite side, go inside the little hole in the wall, follow the path, and backstab the campers."

It can also be played in all teams.\n   Villa takes place on a large mansion that is in the middle of the map. The mansion is noticeably empty, the only things inside are two staircases. There is also a really spacious area outside that has, a small patch of grass with a palm tree outside and next to it, a gate leading to a non-accessible staircase outside the playable area, a cliff walk on the side of the building, another set of stairs outside that is accessible, a arch way leading to a ramp that has a couple of boxes next to it, and a walk way. The mansion takes place on somewhat of a cliff edge.\n   Falling off of the map will result in you dying and losing a level, just like any other map hazard.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   Villa is an extremely small map with a few spawns. Like Sandtown, this map is extremely small and will pretty much always have a skirmish happening somewhere. Unlike Sandtown, however, Villa has more chokepoints and fewer places to simply point and shoot down. Be careful!\n   Spawns are likely to swap frequently. Like any other small map, pay attention to where your team is going and react accordingly.\n   The stairs are a particularly useful vantage point, but you shouldn't stay there for long.\n   Any area of the house can be considered a kill-zone, considering how closed the place is. Be ready for either sudden kills or sudden deaths, you never know what could happen.\n   Since there are so many closed areas, Villa is an ideal map for practicing/performing trickstabs. If you can react and/or predict an enemy's moves, you can skillfully maneuver and demote them accordingly.\n   The roof is a very strong vantage point and is usually accessed through boost jumping. If you manage to get up there, camp and use it while you can.\n   While boost jumping is the easiest way to access the roof, there is a lesser-known path involving the balcony near the big staircase. Simply jump on the railing, then crouch jump onto the roof.\n   The Golden Knife is easier to use on this map compared to others. With its high speed and double-jump capability can allow you to access the roof through unconventional means, allowing you to easily flank other enemies. Trickstabbing is viable too, as the abundance of closed spaces works to your advantage.\n   It is highly recommended to take alternate routes on this map since most of the battles happen inside the house, and you can get easily spawn-camped.\n   Shotguns are very viable on this map since the map is very closed and there is plenty of corridors and small rooms."

These include:\nThe Ferris wheel, the most used, the easiest, and most useful vantage point to use, as hiding in the car not only shields you from damage, but it also gives you a nice view, allowing you to fire upon any unsuspecting players.\nAny and all of the roofs present on the map.\nThe top of the dropping machine ride, the highest point on the map.\nThe trees, not commonly used but still useful nonetheless.\nThis map is very open, making snipers and straight-shooting weapons ideal. Weapons that can boost jump are also especially useful considering the many height vantages.\nThe top of the dropping machine is the highest point in the map, making it useful for sniping, but not ideal for other weapons. It's hard enough to get there anyway, so stick to other spots. Unless you want to meme or pick off enemies from longer ranges, then go for it.\nThe roller coaster is a strange feature of the map. You'll likely not hit any of the enemies while on it, but they likely won't hit you either. Getting hit by the roller coaster will count as an environmental death and will likely demote you. Note that if you exit the roller coaster while the roller coaster is still moving you will be demoted.\nYou'll have a particularly hard time securing a kill with the Golden Knife in most situations on this map. Try to take alternative routes or drop from a high place to give yourself the best bet at winning.\nFlanking is practically impossible, so you would have to rely on direct combat. Weapons that have a good movement speed to get to the front line faster with straight-forward shooting like the MP9-S will strive well."

A cobblestone wall blocks the two sides of the map, however there are some ways around it, with there being a shed that you can climb over to get to the other side, and a 2 planks on the other.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   Safehouse is the most straight forward map of all of the maps. With an open spawn area and a closed house area, a skirmish is likely always happening on this map.\nMost players will try to get as many kills as possible going through the main hallway and the kitchen. If you want to get the drop on them, go through one of the windows and flank.\nThe roof is a very strong vantage point, especially if the enemy is spawning in the lower spawns. If you get there, exploit it to its fullest potential.\nIf you want to avoid the house in its entirety, go to the walls and use the planks to flank the enemy.\nThe lower spawn is possibly the worst area to be in on this map. It is, quite literally, an uphill battle from there. Work with your team to push and regain the upper spawn, then turn the tables!\nThe stairs are a nice section to camp on if the enemy is spawning from the upper spawns. Since most of them will be looking down the hallway, pick off any unfortunate souls, then book it once you start getting shot at.\nThe roof, the trees, and the large window on upper-spawn side of the house can be used to get the drop on anybody walking into the hallway. This is especially useful when you're on the Golden Knife.\nWhich is that you're likely to have a hard time getting a kill on this map unless the person you're chasing is inside the house. Use any of the flank routes mentioned above, and win!"

Players who get hit by one of these cars can be killed.\n Street Corner also has a sewer, which is an L-shaped corridor with two levels, accessible by ladder. The sewer is a very popular part of Street Corner, due to the spawns within and easy to access routes to its location.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   If you want to find an alternate route, the most obvious are above the sewers, where you can flank.\n Spawns tend to be very random and will mix up so be wary and check all possible spawns, at the end of the sewers, entrances to the sewers, and more.\n Trivia:\n   Street Corner was originally made for Trouble In Robloxity, a removed ROLVe game.\n This map was originally set more in the day-time when it was first released however it was removed on the same day.\n Players could walk into the sewer duct underground, which caused a cutscene that featured your avatar coming out of the door of the red building next to the bakery to play, as well as a flushing sound. When the cutscene ended, players would end up above the surface.

There are tunnels on both sides of the map to connect the pathways. The terrain is rough outside the buildings leaving one team to fight up the hill.\n There is almost no cover in this map, so players cannot hide behind a wall to avoid being hit. This will most likely result in very quick deaths, so players must try to get as many kills as possible before dying. This map relies on brute-forcing attacks, where the most successful player is the one that can get the most kills within a short time span.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   Hillside is a fairly large map. Try to flank as much as possible so you could eliminate players by surprise.\n Long-range weapons strive on the hill part while close-range weapons strive in the corridors\n Like the first tip, it is a fairly large map, and flanking could take a while. The PIZZA can be useful in this situation, giving you the speed boost and allows you to catch up to opponents, probably the easiest way to get a knife kill.\n Trivia:\n   The entirety of the map's development was streamed, and was created in a few days.\n Hillside used to be able to host FFA games, but this was removed due to the lack of places for players to spawn without being spawn-killed.\n Only one building is accessible, a gift shop, which uses assets from Stinky's Coffee shop from Boulevard.\n The gift shop has a micro-toilet on the shelf after a viewer requested it.\n There used to be a Gurt easter egg but it was removed.\n Gurt was the pig and the mascot for the Egg Hunt 2018 event.\n As of March 21st, 2019, Hillside is the only map in Arsenal to use triangle terrain.\n On September 28th, 2019, the map has received an autumn makeover.\n In private servers, there was a Hillside-Green version.\n On February 4, 2019, there was a lightning rework on the map.\n A different icon was used for a couple days with a new lighting, however later was reverted to the old icon.\n Map History:\n   02/27/19: Added into the game of Arsenal.\n 09/28/19: Changed map theme to autumn.\n 12/14/19: Renamed to Snowside for Christmas and changed the map theme.\n 02/06/20: Reverted back to Hillside.\n 02/13/20: New icon reverted.\n 06/20/20: Added secret entrance, dead cow and hint as a part of the Cryptid Hunt.\n 10/25/20: Removed the secret entrance, dead cow and the Cryptid Hunt hint.\n 12/16/20: Changed back to the Snowside theme.\n 02/03/21: Reverted back to Hillside."

         "info":"General Information:\n   Spookytown was added in the Halloween Update II, and was removed on October 7, 2020. It takes place in a carnival-like area.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   Sandtown, being one of the smallest maps in the game, means there will always be a firefight somewhere on the map, no exceptions. With constantly shifting spawns, bullets flying from every corner, this map promises never-ending action gameplay.\n Spawns are likely to shift at any given moment and pay attention to where your teammates are heading and figure out where the enemy is going to come from next.\n While heights are often a huge advantage in other maps, in Sandtown, it is relevant. The small map size means that the enemy could come from anywhere. The only option is to stay on your toes and eliminate anybody who crosses your path.\n Explosives and shotguns are useful on this map. Enemies are likely to press their faces against the camera or bunch up constantly, so take advantage of those situations!\n The plane is a viable camping spot, but as stated before, you're likely to either fall behind or get picked off.\n You can walk on the clotheslines by platforming on the arch near the building spawn. While it might not be too useful, since it leaves you open, it's good if your opponents are focused on where your teammates are. Flank them and secure kills.\n The Golden Knife is extremely dangerous in this map, since the wielder can quite literally jump from anywhere with its double jump capability. It has many parkour queues. If you happen to get your hands on it, platform onto a higher spot and get the drop on an unsuspecting enemy. Preferably, a rooftop.\n The middle of the map is usually where the fights go on play, go seek for higher heights to not be part of it.\n The building that looks over the entire center of the map can easily be ambushed if you fail to keep track of the stairs. Check the route on the side to quickly deal with flankers.\n Trivia:\n   Sandtown is a recreated version of the map with the same name from the mobile shooter game Respawnables.\n Sandtown is one of the only maps to be locked on two teams. Another map on two teams is Dizzy.\n An animation for the airplane crashing into the building was added in the second Summer Update.\n Originally, there were wanted posters in the map, however, they were removed.\n The fallen airplane wing used to have a skull spray-painted on it, this was removed as well.\n Prior the Summer Update II revamp, a moped from Work at a Pizza Place, a game on ROBLOX was featured on the map.\n During the release of the revamp, players were able to enter the house in the middle of the map. Unfortunately, it was blocked the following day because the developers changed their minds.[1]\n Spookytown is the only reskin of a map to have coexisted with said map in the voting pool.\n During the Gun Game era, a unknown metal wall can be seen blocking the entrance on one of towers.\n Map History:\n   09/12/15: Added into Gun Game.\n 02/04/16: Removed from Arsenal.\n 07/06/17: Re-added to the archived version of Arsenal.\n 12/16/18: Sandtown is forced on two teams.\n 06/05/19: Skyboxes raised.\n 06/06/19: Adjusted lighting.\n 06/09/19: Minor collision fixes on Sandtown.\n 12/23/19: Icon updated.\n 06/20/20: Revamped in the Summer Update II of Arsenal.\n 06/21/20: A minor update:\n More improvements.\n Fixed plants and window.\n Stairs now have the DIY glide.\n Optimized skybox textures.\n 10/31/20: Name changed to Spookytown and changed theme to Halloween.\n 11/01/20: A minor update:\n Changed sky to night-time.\n Collided the entrance behind the stairways building.\n Received a new icon.\n 11/02/20: Removed the ghost of hitboxes.\n 11/07/20: Re-added back Sandtown to the public rotation.\n 11/20/20: Removed Spookytown from Arsenal.\n 12/19/20: Optimizations:\n Replaced some barrels.\n Patched some objects that weren't rendered on the lowest setting.\n Less shadows drawn.\n 12/24/20: Optimized skybox.\n 05/11/21: Added 4 bananas around the map."

However, it was re-added in the Anniversary Update and was reworked, but then removed again.\n   It takes place in a compact paintball arena. The map features two spawn rooms, one for blue, one for red, players spawn here and then battle it out in the corridors. The map is mirrored so both sides are the same with some slight differences in prop placement.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   Treat this map like Dizzy, albeit bigger with many, many more chokepoints. The amount of cover present always ensures you'll either kill quickly or die quickly. Because of this, rounds on this map tend to either go really fast or somewhat slowly. Always be prepared here!\n   Shotguns are extremely useful in this map, as you'll almost always engage in close-range combat.\n   The center area is a hub for kills and deaths, with most players never advancing to the other spawn. Because of this, the spawns are unlikely to swap, rather staying stagnant.\n   The outer section is an ideal route to take if you want to flank. Do be wary that it's very easy for an opponent to hide and pick you off if they spot you, due to the abundance of cover.\n   Weapons that can jump boost are king in this map. If you can get over the walls, you'll be able to see exactly where everyone is, and they won't have much space to move. Get jumping!\n   The Golden Knife can arguably be either the worst or best weapon for this map. Combined with its double jump, you'll have a much easier time getting past the chokepoints and jumping from cover to cover. However, since the space that most run around is so small, it's likely you'll die before you can stab the enemy. To ensure your best chance of winning, flank the enemy using the outer circle.\n   The regular knife is also pretty good for this map as well, as the small space could work to your advantage when trying to demote someone. Although the enemy is more likely to pick you off first.\n   Two words: Spy's Playground. This map is heaven if you like flanking behind the enemy and demote them or perform trickstabs, maneuvers that rely on tricking an enemy for a cheeky backstab. If you can perform these maneuvers and predict enemy movement, this will instantly become you're favorite. Stair-stabs, corner-stabs (especially), matadors, drop-stabs, understabs, and maybe even circle-stabs.\nTrivia:\n   The ALPHA and early models of the map can be viewed here and here.\n   This map has an area that shows opposite team Delinquents.\n   The top of the walls can be reached in several ways.\n   This map was one of the shortest lasting maps in the game after the Mega Update.\n   The creator of the map, back in the Gun Game time of Arsenal, was making a new map called Sand Dunes to replace this map.\n   However, it was never finished and is currently unreleased. The only thing that was finished was the Crimson spawn location.\n   This (before the revamp) is the fifth map to not be exclusive to private servers after their removal, first being Canyon, second being Bank, third being de_vertigo, fourth being Aztec, sixth being Nuke Bunker, seventh being original Safehouse.\n Map History:\n   05/12/16: Added into the ALPHA phase of Arsenal.\n   08/10/16: Removed from the archived phase of Arsenal.\n   11/27/19: Remastered and re-added into Arsenal.\n   11/30/19: Increased invisible barriers to avoid players from escaping the map.\n   12/03/19: Removed from the public rotation."

It is the sole arcamap in the Arcade gamemode.\n   Lunar consists of one central space where both teams fight, with two outer areas where the teams spawn. Players can fight on the outside or the inside of the map. If one arrives on top of the walls, via Rocket/Recoil Jumping they will start taking 5 damage per second and an indicator will pop up on the screen, notifying that the player is taking damage. The player must be physically on the top in order to take damage, not above with some space between.\nTips and Tricks:\n   With many spots to fall off and die, a plethora of chokepoints and a strangely made center area, Lunar is a map that you'll either grow to love or absolutely despise.\n   The center height vantage is your greatest friend, as there are few areas to fall into pits up there. Land your shots and don't get hit, and you're pretty much set.\n   There are many pits in this map, one step in the wrong direction can result in a death, be careful!\n   Unlike many other maps, skirmishes do not happen often in this one. Instead, two opposing players tend to run into each other and end up killing the other. Because of this, it's imperative that you are ready for someone to jump around a corner at any moment.\n   If you happen to run into someone camping on the center height vantage, flee and try to take another route. It's almost impossible to challenge someone there. If you have teammates alongside you, then you stand a chance.\n   Explosives are your best friend in this map. Knock as many people as you can into pits and boost your score by hilarious amounts.\n   Flanking using the boost pads on the side often gets you a large kill streak.\n   The only weapon that is available in this map when you spawn is G-17. However, there are also some weapons for pickups: DB shotgun, Trench Gun, Barrett, Peacemaker, Rocket launcher and AUG.\n   Unlike other self-killing scenarios, falling into the pits will not result in demotion due to the Arcade gamemode.\n   In Arcade, shotgun jumping with the DB Shotgun will consume 5 ammo, but will have enough power to launch you to the roof. You will experience radiation on the roof floor.\n Trivia:\n   This is the first map that does not take place on Earth.\n   Outside of the map, Station 06 is visible.\n   After the map was removed along with Dust II, it was added back as the only map in the Arcade gamemode.\n   After its removal from private servers, the map is still playable in the same gamemode.\n Map History:\n   11/27/19: Added into the Anniversary Update of Arsenal.\n   12/01/19: Added clipping.\n   12/04/19: Added new spawn barriers that stay collidable for a few seconds when spawning.\n   03/07/20: Removed from the public rotation.\n   03/20/20: Re-added back to the public rotation as a part of the Arcade gamemode.\n   04/19/20: Removed from the public rotation alongside the Arcade gamemode.\n   03/16/21: Removed from private servers."

The insides of the giant factory help make close-range combat, but makes a maze to confuse players.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   The best way to not be stuck inside the giant factory is to find a ladder to have an upper ground.\n   Due to somewhat small gaps in the factory, shotguns are perfect for battling.\n   This map also features long-range combat on the pavement section and on the higher grounds.\n   A good way to get kills inside of the factory is to stay on the crates. This way, you can travel quickly as well as stay out of the maze.\nTrivia:\n   The map begun its development on April 9, 2020.[1]\n   On the Factory map, there are some forklifts with numbers that are referenced.\n   These numbers are 914, 682, 3008, 343, 2521, 708 , 999 , and 049, all referencing to the numbers of SCPs. 914 is a clockwork machine which can upgrade or degrade any object or creature placed in it, 682 being a giant indestructible lizard, 3008 being an endless IKEA store with hostile employees, 343 being God, 2521 being an SCP that must never be mentioned, 708 being an orange forklift that causes people want to ride it, 999 being a playful orange mass of slime with a dog-like behavior, and lastly 049 being a plague doctor that can turn human beings to reanimated zombies.\n   Another number reference on a forklift is 1273, which is a reference to the Tiktok trend and song, Rockefeller Street.\n   After the release of its newer version under the name of Warehouse, Factory can still be selected in private servers.\nMap History:\n   05/16/20: Added into the Community-Ops Update of Arsenal.\n   06/20/20: Removed from the public rotation."

Wrong, this complex is filled with players out to battle with their guns! The level-dependent complex can be either annoying or epic. Either way, there are strategies to master this map and unusual stuff in an office.\n   Always go to the higher levels to take advantage of enemies easier.\n   The vents can help you flank the players without getting hurt.\n   The stairs can help access to the top of the building.\n   The truss ladders on the side of the building can also help access multiple levels of the building.\nTrivia:\n   The map begun its development on September 27, 2018.\n   The map can be played here.\n   This map was originally made for ROLVe's other game, Robber, however, DevRolve liked it and decided to put it on the rotation in Arsenal.\n   In the Anniversary Update, the bottom floor part was removed by developers. This is because most players never battle at the bottom floor, so they decided to remove the bottom floor almost entirely.\n   The stairs are next to player spawns so they have access to get on the roof easily instead of rocket jumping.\nMap History:\n   01/15/19: Added into Arsenal.\n   06/05/19: Removed from the public rotation.\n   11/27/19: Remastered and re-added back to the public rotation.\n   06/26/20: Removed from the public rotation."

It takes place at a giant pool surrounded with multiple buildings. Poolside was re-added in the second Summer Update but was removed 2 days later.\n   It features a pool, a basketball court, a DJ Set, buildings on either side of the map, and many other unique features. It is quite larger than some of the other maps currently in the game and can be played in most gamemodes.\nTrivia:\n   The map begun its development on June 9th, 2019, 2 weeks before it was eventfully added.\n   The map can be played here.\n   Shooting the yellow plaque on the pool wall flashes up a message saying Poolside by IcyTea, a reference to one of the creators of the map, IcyTea.\n   There is a poster on the right building which shows John Brick pointing a Golden Gun saying You’re Breathtaking!. This is a reference to E3 2019 in which Keanu Reeves (who's most notable for acting in John Wick as the titular character) points at a person in the audience and says the same thing.\n   There were used to be bathrooms in the buildings and most secrets in the map.

Both sides of the map are identical, with multiple rooms and a railing that runs around the map.

Two trains will go through the middle of the map's railroads at a very fast rate, however only the front of the trains will deal environmental kills. Around the map, there are many barricades, boards, and boxes scattered.\nTips and Tricks:\n   Trains whoosh by as bullets fly everywhere across the map. How do you survive?\n   When the subway trains pass by, use this time to replenish health and reload your weapons. This makes you ready for battle when the trains go away.\n   This may be risky, but from the top floor, jump on top of the subway trains while they are moving and jump on the enemy team.\n   Most of the fighting is in the center of the map, so go up to the second floor to go to the other side of the map without getting hit by trains.\n   While on the second floor, you have the high ground to mow down your enemies.\n   You can shoot through the ramps and the second floor allowing you to get some kills without the enemy expecting it.\n   There are vents just above the second floor on either side of the subway station. Although you don't get a good view from the sides, you can shoot at any enemy players on the second floor and parts of the first. All the while, making you stealthy as people rarely check the vents.\nTrivia:\n   Unlike other moving hazards, only the front of the trains kill you.\n   This map is the 2nd map to be made by AzireBlox that is added into Arsenal, the first being Silo 20.\nMap History:\n   03/25/20: Added into the Post-Showtime!

         "name":"ASSAULT",
         "info":"Map Information:\n Assault is a recreated version of the popular CS:GO and CS Source map known as: cs_assault. It takes place around an industrial warehouse, with access to the area being blocked off. It's separated into 5 distinct parts, the train station, the warehouse on the left side of the map, the two parallel streets next to them, and the long street that connects the warehouse and the parallel streets.\n The Warehouse has an upper section and a lower section. The upper section has a door in the back that leads to one of the parallel streets, and there is also a door in the lower section that leads to the same street. There is a larger warehouse door that leads to the long street.\n The Train Station is positioned above the rest of the landmarks, making it a good place to camp.\n The two parallel streets just lead onto the main connecting road. People will spawn at the end of these roads, so it's nice to dip around and shoot some of them. The two parallel roads are connected by a small alleyway that houses a few trash bags and broken cars.\n The main street connects all of the previous landmarks. You can enter the warehouse, go onto either of the two parallel streets and walk up to the train station. There aren't any decent barricades on this street, and makes you slightly easier to hit.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   A map straighter than a railgun shot, choked by a small garage, accented by a stocked warehouse, and tied into a knot of endless firefight with the trademark train station, Assault is a map that has two simple states of combat: constant straight shooting chaos, or hilariously one-sided vantage pushes. Considering that most matches in Arsenal aren't that coordinated, you can count on the first happening most of the time.\n Many weapons that have tight spread and good accuracy are extremely powerful in this map due to the amount of open space and straight sightlines. Snipers are also considerably more useful than normal thanks to this, allowing potentially awful weapons such as the M40 and MS556 to become somewhat easier to get past.\n Common spawns are in the warehouse, at the end of the streets, and near the stairs that lead to the top of the train station. The warehouse spawn is one you'll want to target often as there is little chance for interruption thanks to it being a closed space. You'll likely snag several kills if you place your shots right as most would be expecting the enemy to come from outside the warehouse, so get flanking!\n Rocket/recoil jumping poses a large advantage, going quickly from one side of the map to another. This becomes much more useful when you reach the roof of the garage, as it not only covers the roof of the warehouse, but pretty much every other part of the map aside from inside the warehouse. You can also access the train station roof, a more niche spot due to it making you a bigger target than Hackula, but somewhat useful as well. It's got a nice view, after all.\n Spawncamps are really prevalent and easy to perform in this map, especially on the street spawns. These spawns have ZERO protection, so whoever spawns there will fall victim to anybody aiming in the general direction of them. If you happen to see someone pop into existence in that general area, raise hell.\n Knifing in general on this map is pretty painful, thanks to how open it is. The only remotely viable spots to even attempt it is in the warehouse, garage, and the stairs up to the train station. Even then, it's really easy to get any of your tries to demote your foes shot down. This makes the Golden Knife difficult to kill with, as you have to hope and pray that an opponent will be lined up in what would essentially be a perfect spot. Try to go for the good knife spots, or just camp around and challenge a knife fight in the warehouse if you're feeling chicken.\n Trivia:\n   The map begun its development on May 26th, 2018.\n The map can be played here.\n In the 2.4 Update, the map was changed to be forced on 2 teams.\n However, on 02/13/20, this was reverted back and remains like that to this day.\n Map History:\n   01/15/19: Added into the game of Arsenal.\n 01/29/19: Changes to Assault.\n 02/01/19: Assault is forced on 2 teams.\n 02/13/19: Assault is now free to 4 teams and FFA.\n 05/31/19: Fixed vent collision and box spawn.\n 06/05/19: 2 collision fixes for Assault.\n 06/06/19: Adjusted lighting to Assault.\n 06/09/19: OOB fixes to Assault.\n 09/01/19: Fixed collision on the tracks.\n 11/19/19: Icon updated.\n 08/15/20: Fixed the blue box."

         "info":"Map Information:\n   Boulevard is a map released in the 2.5 update. It's a very large and spacey map that favors long-ranged weapons such as snipers, or perfectly accurate weapons. However, it does provide some areas where you can confront enemies in closer ranged combat, so inaccurate weapons are not completely useless.\n Boulevard takes place in a residential suburban city with multiple shops.\n The map features many places to go into. These things include a track where a trolley comes to run over anyone in its path, resulting in a demotion (you can hear it coming by its ringing sound); a gas station called Scoobies; a coffee shop called Stinky is; a juice store called Stink Juice; and multiple vehicles scattered around the area.\n The small buildings have nice rooms that overlook the main road and gas station. As long as the area is secured with a small team, domination is essentially guaranteed. However, retaliating players may simply counter-snipe or use explosives to dislodge you.\n Tips and Tricks:\n   Boulevard is a very open map with action in specific areas. How do you win?\n If you have shotguns or high spread automatics, these are your best friends at the gas station, parking lot, and inside the buildings.\n If you happen to have a weapon with the Rocket/Shotgun Jumping ability, use this to your advantage to hide on top of buildings to mow your enemies down below.\n The spawn locations on this map can give you and your team a great opportunity to corner the enemy.\n The trolley can be easily avoided because of its distinctive sound, however, this does not mean to always stay at its path.\n Scoped weapons such as the Barrett or the G11 can be easily used for picking off enemies at longer ranges.\n The Golden Knife is arguably the best or worst in situations. For flanking, either go behind the office buildings or behind Stinky's Coffee shop.\n The skin Froggy is obtainable here by killing 5 people near a frog. The frog will get bigger and bigger until it will start hopping to get the skin. You have to follow it and it will lead you to a door with wood on it. You have to break that wood and when you're finished breaking it, it will teleport you to a different server with a different map, the Apartment. You will see a stand with moving animals on it. You have to shoot all the animals except the frog until confetti comes out of the stand, and that means you got the Froggy skin\n You can get the unusual Froggy skin by doing the Froggy quest normally, but you have to time the Frog and the train to make them collide.\n Trivia:\n   The gas station, Scoobies is a reference to the mispronunciation of Scoobis, created by zKevin. The gas station store (Biggie Mart) even has a Scoobies easter-egg in one of the fridges.\n One of the gas pumps has Roblox studio is loading written on it, which may or may have not happened because a certain viewer gave a suggestion.\n The gas station was previously named Milo, and had a picture of Milo. It had to be changed as it is currently a picture of a duck with oops under it.\n as of 07/5/2019, it has been changed to a low-quality image of a yellow car.\n Scapter's Wizard hat is seen on a dumpster near the gas station, this appeared after his account got deleted.\n You can find Kevin from Ed Edd N' Eddy in the juice store.\n There is a pair of binoculars on top of the brick building in between Scoobies & Stinky's Coffee.\n You can find Stinky's Coffee cups around the map.\n The background buildings are based on buildings in San Francisco's Fillmore district.\n TC has his name on a computer screen in the bookstore.\n During the development live stream, it was a picture of a Robloxian in a gray sweater, and black pants wearing a top hat holding a radio saying I shall rain hellfire upon everyone., this was removed.\n This map's development was also streamed, much like Hillside.\n The sign at Stinky's Coffee shows it has a drive-thru, and it's stylized as a 'Drive-and-wait-for-15-minutes-thru'.\n On the map, StinkBooks is having a special offer: buy one, get none.\n During the development of this, TC was searching for an image of a trolley and Redacted By TCTully's special cowboy agency.\n Boulevard currently holds the Froggy quest.\n The time between a tram passing through boulevard varies. Anywhere from 10-15 seconds to 2+ minutes.\n Map History:\n   02/14/19: Added into the 2.5 Update of Arsenal.\n 02/15/19: Changes to Boulevard.\n 06/21/20: Added a frog as a part of the Froggy quest.\n 10/29/20: Added the Froggy unusual steps."
